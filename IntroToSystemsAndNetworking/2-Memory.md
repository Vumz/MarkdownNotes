# Memory
To do any sort of action on a computer, we need to load and store stuff in memory.

### Memory Addressing

### Endianness
Endianness refers to how the bytes are ordered within the word. There are two types of endianness
* **Little Endianness:** Least significant bit is first in the word
	* Backwards in memory
* **Big Endianness:** Most significant bit is last in the word
