# LC- 2200

## Software Convention

### Registers:
0. zero is always zero (read-only)
1. at is used for target address
2. v0 is for return value [CALLER SAVED]
3-5. a0 - a2 are the argument/parameter registers [CALLER SAVED]
6-8. t0 - t2 are the temporary registers [CALLER SAVED]
9-11. s0 - s2 are the caller's registers (saved registers) [CALLEE SAVED]
12. k0 is reserved for OS/traps
13. sp is used for stack pointer [CALLER SAVED]
14. fp is used for frame pointer [CALLEE SAVED]
15. ra is used for return address [CALLER SAVED]

### Procedure call/return:
1. Caller saves temporary registers on the stack.
2. Caller places parameters on the stack.
3. Caller allocates space for additional return values on the stack.
4. Caller saves previous return address on stack.
5. Caller does JALR.
6. Callee saves saved registers it plans to use on the stack.
7. Callee allocates space for local variables on the stack.
8. Callee restores saved registers prior to return.
9. Upon return, caller restores return address.
10. Caller stores return values as required.
11. Caller moves stack pointer to remove parameters from stack.
12. Caller restores any temporary registers on the stack.

Activation Record: The portion of the stack that is relevant to the current executing procedure.
Frame Pointer: Contains the address of a known point in the activation record to know which stack frame are you in.

Instructions can be grouped into categories based on the number of operands for the instruction (zero, one, two and three).

### Instruction Format:
1. R-type: ADD, NAND
2. I-type: ADDI, LW, SW, BEQ
3. J-type: JALR
4. O-type: HALT
