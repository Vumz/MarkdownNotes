# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is one of the most common applications for machine learning
* Given a data set, coming up with a function that best maps _x_ to __y__


### Terminology
_m_: The number of training examples
_x_: The features (or the number of features)
__y__: The target variable (aka the output)
_Hypothesis_: A function that describes the data

### Hypothesis
A hypothesis is a function that seeks to 

### Cost Function
Let us define a cost function to be the difference between the expected value, and the value generated by the hypothesis
	* Thus, the best fit line is the line with the least cost function, i.e. J(x) is closest to 0
