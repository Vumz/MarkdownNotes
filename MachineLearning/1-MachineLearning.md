# Machine Learning
---

* Machine learning is a type of *artificial intelligence* that allows computers to solve problems based on patterns that they find implicitly
	* No need to hard code cases, making the algorithm adaptive
* Terminology
	1. __Features:__ The input into the algorithm
	2. __Labels:__ The expected output of the algorithm
	3. __Supervised Learning:__ The program is fed both the inputs and a desired output, teaching it a specific pattern
		* __Regression:__ Working backwards from data to find a rule that describes it 
	4. __Unsupervised Learning:__ There is no label, so the computer must find its own patterns
		* __Clustering:__ The machine finds clusters of data
		* E.g. Isolating sounds from a noisy room 

### Uses for Machine Learning
Machine learning has numerous uses, allowing developers to create dynamic algorithms that work in a diverse array of situations
* Recommendation algorithms
* Email filtering
* Stock price predictions
* Marketing
* Economics
* Search Engines
* Natural Language Processing

Basically, if there is any degree of pattern recognition involved, machine learning can help out a lot

### Approaches
* __Association Rule Learning__
	- Discovers interesting relations between variables in large datasets
* __Artificial Neural Networks__
* __Bayesian Networks__
* __Clustering__
	- Assigning a set of observations into subsets
	- E.g. Identifying apples and oranges
* __Decision Trees__
	- Machine learning implemented with a decision tree
* __Deep Learning__
	- Multiple layer neural networks
* __Genetic Algorithms__
* __Inductive Logic Programming__
* __Learning Classifier Systems__
* __Reinforcement Learning__
* __Representation Learning__
* __Rule Based Machine Learning__
* __Sparse Dictionary Learning__
* __Similarity and Metric Learning__
	- 
* __Support Vector Machines__
	- Supervised learning methods used for classification and regressions
