# Advanced Search Algorithms
What if there are a very large number of states, or instead of finding one goal state, we need to find the "best" state? Such problems are called *optimization* problems, and require specialized algorithms to deal with them. These algorithms are called **local search algorithms**.

### Terminology
* **Local Search Algorithm:** 
* **State- Space Landscape:** A graph, with the y- axis (elevation) being the objective function and the x- axis (location) being the state
* **Local Minimum:** A trough in the state- space landscape
* **Local Maxima:** A peak in the state- space landscape
* **Global Minimum:** The lowest trough in the state- space landscape
* **Global Maximum:** The highest peak in the state- space landscape
