# Introduction
Artificial intelligence is the branch of computer science that tries to

### What is Intelligence?
* There is no good definition for intelligence.
* Turing Test (1950)
	* An entity is intelligent if it performs behaviors a person might reasonably believe to require intelligence.
	* Four characteristics of a machine that passes Turing Test:
		1. **Natural Language Processing**: To understand and communicate in human language
		2. **Knowledge Representation**: To store what it knows or hears
		3. **Automated Reasoning**: to use the stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions
		4. **Machine Learning**: To learn from past patterns and adapt to new circumstances
* Two basic distinctions among Artificial Intelligence:


| Strong AI | Weak AI |
| --- | --- |
| Emulate human intelligence | Solves a specific task |
| Broad/ general scope | For a task usually done by humans |
| Beats the Turing Test | Most AI today |
| Human Level | Human Level |

### History
Artificial intelligence in some form or another has existed throughout history, beginning with automatons:
1. **Automatons**: Mechanical robots that would do one task
2. **Mechanical Turk**: 18th- century chess playing automaton. Was a hoax


However, artificial intelligence as a science did not begin until WWII:
1. **Alan Turing**: Mathematical formulation of computation
	* *Lambda Calculus* in the 30s
2. **McCulloch and Pitts** (1943): Created a model of artificial neurons for a theoretical AI machine
	* Donald Hebb proposed an improvement in 1949 called *Hebbian Rule*
3. **SNARC** (1950): First artificial neural network
4. **Dartmouth Conference** (1956): Conference discussing feasibility of AI. Hopes were high!

After the Dartmouth conference, there were exaggerated expectations of AI.

##### Timeline
1. Pre- 1960s: Neanderthal AI
	* Expected to model a human and everything they did
	* Early Successes in logic and symbolic reasoning:
		* Computer theorem solvers
		* Chess machines
2. 1970s- 80s: Knowledge Based AI
	* Identified that humans don't make their decisions from scratch
	* Modelling humans and their processes
	* **Identified problems**
		* Expert Systems: medical diagnoses, automated jobs, etc.
	* Rule based systems: if this, then that
	* Very brittle systems
3. 1987- 1993: AI Winter
	* Lack of funding and physical limitations of computers reached
4. 1993- Present: The Rebirth
	* More powerful computers (GPUs)
	* Better formulated problems
	* Better/ more accessible data
	* **Machine Learning Revolution**
